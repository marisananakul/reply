# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> First I used a test js file to run example code from the library. After understanding how the example worked, I read through the index.js code function by function to understand every piece. One thing that made it easy was looking at where error messages were produced so I understood what functions were doing what part in terms of errors. Then I worked my way through other methods based on their variable names. One thing that would have made this easier is the author using clearer variable names and defining every variable type. A lot of the time I had issues trying to figure out what type a variable was and had to guess based on the methods/their treatment was for that variable.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> This means to conceptualize and generalize the functionality of a function without revealing implementation details. To a CS142 student, I would ask them "How would you explain this method to your parents or anyone that has no coding experience? Focus on the what, not the how."


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 10 hours.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Isabella Spaletta, Sam Wahbeh


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> This was a very difficult assignment. I don't like how we are pushed into knowing how to read code when we're so used to learning/knowing how to write code. I think it would've been more useful if we were given helpful tips on how to read someone else's code.
